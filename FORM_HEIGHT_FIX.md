# Form Height Overflow - Fixed! ✅

## **🔧 Problem Solved**

### **Issue:**
- Form was taking full height of modal/dialog
- Title and action buttons were hidden/cut off
- Users couldn't see "Add Make" button or modal title
- Form was not scrollable

### **Solution Applied:**
1. **Constrained Height:** `max-h-[70vh]` - Limits form to 70% of viewport height
2. **Scrollable Content:** `overflow-y-auto` - Makes form content scrollable
3. **Compact Spacing:** Reduced spacing from `space-y-8` to `space-y-6`
4. **Smaller Components:** 
   - Reduced textarea rows from 3 to 2
   - Reduced upload area from `h-40` to `h-32`
   - Smaller section spacing (`space-y-4` instead of `space-y-6`)
5. **Scroll Padding:** `pr-2` - Added right padding for scroll bar

## **🎯 Key Changes**

### **Before:**
```tsx
<div className="space-y-8">
  {/* Form content taking unlimited height */}
</div>
```

### **After:**
```tsx
<div className="max-h-[70vh] overflow-y-auto space-y-6 pr-2">
  {/* Form content constrained and scrollable */}
</div>
```
